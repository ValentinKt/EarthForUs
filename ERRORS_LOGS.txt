- Code: 42804

Signup error (HTTP):
- Endpoint: POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup
- Response: {"error":"null value in column \"name\" of relation \"users\" violates not-null constraint","code":"23502"}
- Status: HTTP 500

Login issue (reported):
- Email: john.doe@test.fr
- Password: Azerty123!*
- Outcome: Invalid credentials

Auth test success:
- Script: scripts/test_auth_flow.ts
- Result: PASS: signup + login bcrypt compare works
- Example user: john.doe.test+1763497553778@example.com
API server (dev):
- Instance: http://localhost:3003
- Signup test: HTTP 201 with created user payload
- Example email: valentin.signup.test+1763496595@example.com

Notes:
- Live DB uses uuid for `users.id`; some legacy migrations expect bigint.
- `users` table had `name` NOT NULL; now backfilled and enforced first_name/last_name.
- login route validates via bcrypt compare against `password_hash`.

Next steps:
- Adjust remaining migrations to uuid or mark as applied.
- Add HTTP integration tests for /api/auth/signup and /api/auth/login.
- Verify john.doe@test.fr login via API after restart.
